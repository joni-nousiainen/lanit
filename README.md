# Requirements

- Java 8
- PostgreSQL (9.6)

# Getting started

Create database. By default app uses DB `lanit` and accesses it via `localhost`
with user `lanit` (and password `lanit`).

Run main class `LanitApp` in your IDE or start with Spring Boot Maven Plugin:

    cd <project root folder>
    mvnw spring-boot:run

You can access app at http://localhost:8080/.
